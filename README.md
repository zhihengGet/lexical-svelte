# currently we need to sync with this forked branch

# Goal:

 - migrate to melt-ui/shadcn for components
 - use external library instead creating our own
   - image resize library
   -  colorPicker components
   -  ...
-  use feature based folder architecture instead of plugin folder and nodes folder 
   - ```
     /dialog
       node.svelte
       plugin.svelte.ts
     ```
